Project management
==================

Odoo Project uses the **Kanban** project management system. This means
all projects are broken down into tasks, which are categorized on a
whiteboard according to what production phase they are in.

::: {.admonition}
Did you know?

The word **Kanban** comes from Japanese and refers to the \"visual
board\" management method.

Configuration {#project_management/configuration}
-------------

Open the **Project** app and click `Create`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to start a new project. Enter a
`Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for your project and click
`Create Project`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

You can customize your existing **projects** from the dashboard by
clicking the drop-down toggle button (`⋮`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}) on your project\'s **card**.

This enables a new menu divided into four parts:

-   `View`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: see an overview of your
    project\'s components, such as its `Tasks`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}, `Milestones`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    and `Project Updates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Depending
    on which apps you have activated, more options may be available,
    such as `Documents`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. All uploaded
    files can be found under this menu, as well as in the **Documents**
    app, under `Projects`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"};
-   `Reporting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: analyze your
    project\'s progress and profitability through graphics and
    statistics;
-   **Color**: make a line of color appear on the left side of the card
    so that your project is more recognizable;
-   `Settings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: you can change the
    following:
    -   the `Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the project;
    -   the `Name of the tasks`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} found
        under that project;
    -   the `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} for whom the
        project is intended;
    -   the `Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} used for
        filtering;
    -   the `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} responsible for
        the project;
    -   the employee designated as `Project Manager`{.interpreted-text
        role="guilabel"};
    -   the `Planned Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the
        project;
    -   the total `Allocated Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
        for that project.

Additionally, you can mark the project as `Favorite`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, allowing you to find it using the
`My Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter on the Kanban
view;

Further settings are available under the `Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab. Most of them are *only* available depending on the
activated apps.

Scheduling activities
---------------------

You can schedule **activities** (ex. `Call`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Meeting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, etc.)
per project by clicking on the **clock** icon on a project. Doing so
opens a list with already scheduled activities and allows planning
**new** activities by clicking
`+ Schedule an activity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. On the
pop-up window, select the `Activity Type`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, enter a `Summary`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
for that activity, a `Due Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
assign it to an employee. According to the
`Activity Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, you may have
**additional options** available.

Note

If an activity is **already** scheduled, the icon may change to a
**phone**, **group of people**, or other.
