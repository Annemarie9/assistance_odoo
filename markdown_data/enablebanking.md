Enable Banking
==============

**Enable Banking** is a third-party provider aggregating banking
information from bank accounts all in one place. It offers non-intrusive
connectivity to ASPSPs\' official APIs across Europe without storing
data.



**Odoo** synchronizes directly with banks to get access to all bank
transactions and automatically import them into your database.
