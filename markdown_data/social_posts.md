Social posts
============

The Odoo *Social Marketing* application provides various ways to create
posts for any type of social media outlet.

Posts page
----------

To see a complete overview of posts, go to Odoo
`Social Marketing app --> Posts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Here, on the `Social Posts`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, every post that has been created and posted with
Odoo can be seen and accessed.

There are four different view options for the
`Social Posts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page data: *kanban*,
*calendar*, *list*, and *pivot*.

The view options are located in the upper right corner of the
`Posts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, beneath the search bar.

::: {.tabs}
::: {.tab}
Kanban view

By default, Odoo displays the posts in a kanban view. The information on
this page can be sorted even further, via the left sidebar, where all
connected social accounts and posts can be quickly seen, accessed, and
analyzed.

The kanban view is represented by an
`inverted bar graph icon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
upper-right corner.

{.align-center}
:::

::: {.tab}
Calendar view

The calendar view option displays a visual representation of posts in a
calendar format of when posts were published, or are scheduled to be
published. This option provides a clear overview of any planned day,
week, or month, and Odoo displays all drafted, scheduled, and published
posts.

Clicking on a date reveals a blank social media post detail form, in
which a social media post can be created, and Odoo will post it on that
specific date/time.

The calendar view is represented by a `calendar icon`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} in the upper-right corner.

{.align-center}
:::

::: {.tab}
List view

The list view option is similar to the kanban option, but instead of
individual blocks, all post information is displayed in a clear, list
layout. Each line of the list displays the
`Social Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of every post.

There is also a helpful left sidebar that organizes all posts by
`Status`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and lists all connected
`Social Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, as well.

The list view is represented by four vertical lines in the upper-right
corner.

{.align-center}
:::

::: {.tab}
Pivot view

The pivot view option provides a fully customizable grid table, where
different measures of data can be added and analyzed.

{.align-center}

The pivot view option provides numerous analytical options, allowing for
in-depth, detailed analysis of various posts and metrics.

Click on any `➕ (plus sign) icon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
next to a line in the pivot table to reveal more metric options to add
to the grid.

While in the pivot view, the option to
`Insert in Spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is available,
located to the right of the `Measures`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} drop-down menu, in the upper-left corner of the
`Social Posts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page.

Next to the `Insert in Spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
are three options, specific to the pivot view.

From left to right, those options are:

-   `Flip Axis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which switches the
    *X* and *Y* axis in the grid table.
-   `Expand All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which expands each
    line in the grid, revealing more detailed information related to it.
-   `Download`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which, when clicked,
    instantly downloads the pivot table as a spreadsheet.

### Posts

Clicking on a post from a social media stream reveals a pop-up window,
showcasing the content of that specific post, along with all the
engagement data related to it (e.g. likes, comments, etc.).

{.align-center}

If desired, the user can leave a new comment of the post from the
post\'s pop-up window, by typing one in the
`Write a comment...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and
clicking `Enter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to post that
comment.

### Create leads from comments

Odoo *Social Marketing* also provides the ability to create leads
directly from social media comments.

To create a lead from a comment left on a social media post, click on
the desired post from the dashboard to reveal that post\'s specific
pop-up window. Then, scroll to the desired comment, and click the
`three vertical dots`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to the
right of that comment.

Doing so reveals a drop-down menu with the option:
`Create Lead`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

{.align-center}

Upon clicking `Create Lead`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the
comment\'s drop-down menu, a `Conver Post to
Lead`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears.

{.align-center}

In this pop-up window, select to either:
`Create a new customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, `Link to an
existing customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, or
`Do not link to a customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

If `Link to an existing customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
selected, a new `Customer`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field
appears beneath those options, wherein a customer can be chosen to be
linked to this lead.
:::

Once the desired selection has been made, click the
`Convert`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the bottom of the
`Convert Post to Lead`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up window.
Doing so reveals a fresh lead detail form, where the necessary
information can be entered and processed.

{.align-center}

### Insights

When a social media account stream is added to the *Social Marketing*
dashboard, each stream also displays and links that specific social
media platform\'s KPIs (if the platform has them).

To get redirected to the statistics and metrics related to any social
media account\'s KPIs, click on the `Insights`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} link, located at the top of each stream.

{.align-center}

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

In a multi-company environment, if not *all* pages are selected,
de-authentication happens.

For example, if the companies have 3 *Facebook* pages, but only grant
access to 1, and try to grant access to another at a later date, they
will be de-authenticated, and access to the initial page\'s
insights/analytics will be lost.

So, be sure to add *all* pages for *all* companies in a multi-company
environment to avoid this issue. If a page gets de-autenticated, simply
remove the stream, and re-establish it.

Create and post social media content
------------------------------------

Odoo *Social Marketing* offers the ability to create and post content
for social media accounts directly through the application.

To create content for social media accounts, navigated to the
`Social Marketing app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
click `New Post`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} located in the
upper-right corner of the *Social Marketing* dashboard.

{.align-center}

Or, navigate to `Social Marketing app --> Posts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button.

{.align-center}

Either route reveals a blank social media post detail form that can be
customized and configured in a number of different ways.

{.align-center}

### Post detail form

The social media post detail form in Odoo *Social Marketing* has many
different configurable options available.

#### Company

If working in a multi-company environment, the first field in the
`Your Post`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the social
media post detail form is `Company`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
In this field, select the company that should be connected to this
specific social media post.

#### Post on

If working in a single-company environment, the first field in the
`Your Post`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section of the social
media post detail form is `Post on`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
In this field, determine which social media outlets (streams) this post
is intended to be posted on, and/or which website\'s visitors this post
should be sent to, via push notification, by checking the box beside the
desired option(s).

Odoo automatically provides every available social media account that\'s
been linked to the database as an option in this section. If a social
media account hasn\'t been added as a stream to the *Social Marketing*
application, it will **not** appear as an option on the post template.

Multiple social media outlets (streams) and websites can be selected in
the `Post on`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. At least **one**
option in the `Post on`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field *must*
be selected.

::: {.important}
::: {.title}

:::

In order for the `Push Notification`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
option to appear on the social media post detail form in Odoo *Social
Marketing*, make sure the *Enable Web Push Notifications* feature is
enabled in the *Website* app.

To do that, navigate to
`Website app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, activate
`Enable Web Push Notifications`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, fill
out the corresponding fields, and click `Save`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
:::

#### Message

Next, there\'s the `Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
This is where the main content of the post is created.

In the `Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, type in the
desired message for the social post. After typing, click away from the
`Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to reveal visual
samples of how the post will look on all the previously selected social
media accounts (and/or websites, as push notifications).

Emojis can also be added directly to the text in the
`Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Just click the
`🙂 (smiley face)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, located on
the line of the `Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to
the far right. Clicking this icon reveals a drop-down menu containing
numerous emojis to choose from.

If `Twitter`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is chosen in the
`Post on`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, a character counter
appears beneath the `Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
:::

#### Attach Images

If images are to be used in the post, click the
`Attach Images`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, in the
`Attach Images`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, located
beneath the `Message`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. When
clicked, Odoo reveals a pop-up window. In this pop-up window, select the
desired image from the hard drive, and upload it.

After successfully uploading and attaching the desired image, Odoo
reveals a new preview of the social media post, complete with the
newly-added image, on the right side of the detail form.

{.align-center}

#### Campaign

Next, there is the `Campaign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
This non-required field provides the options to attach this post to a
specific marketing campaign.

To add this post to a pre-existing campaign, click the empty
`Campaign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field to reveal a
drop-down menu, containing all the existing campaigns in the database.
Select the desired campaign from this drop-down menu to add this post to
that campaign.

To create a new campaign directly from the social media post detail
form, start typing the name of the new campaign in the blank
`Campaign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and select either
`Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

{.align-center}

Clicking `Create`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} creates the
campaign, which can be edited/customized later.

Clicking `Create and edit...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} creates
the campaign, and reveals a `Create
Campaign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up form, wherein the
`Campaign Identifier`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
`Responsible`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and
`Tags`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} can be instantly configured.

{.align-center}

When all the desired settings have been entered, click
`Save & Close`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the campaign
and return to the social media post detail form.

#### When

Then, in the `When`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, choose
either `Send Now`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to have Odoo
publish the post immediately, or `Schedule later`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to have Odoo publish the post at a later date and time.

If `Schedule later`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is selected, a
new `Scheduled Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears.
Clicking the empty field reveals a pop-up calendar, in which a future
date and time can be designated.

{.align-center}

After selecting a desired date and time, click `Apply`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, Odoo will promptly publish the post at that
specific date and time on the pre-detemined social media account(s).

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

If scheduling a post, the `Post`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button at the top of the social media post detail form changes to
`Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Be sure to click
`Schedule`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} after completing the
social media post detail form.

Doing so, locks in that specific date/time for Odoo to send the post,
and it changes the status of the post to `Scheduled`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.
:::

#### Push Notification Options

If one (or multiple) `[Push Notification]`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} options are chosen in the `Post on`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field, a specific
`Push Notification Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section
appears at the bottom of the social media post detail form.

{.align-center}

It should be noted that *none* of these fields are required.

The first field in this section is
`Notification Title`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. In this field,
there is the option to add a custom title to the push notification that
will be sent.

To designate a specific page on the website that should trigger this
push notification, enter that page\'s URL in the
`Target URL`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field. Then, once a
visitor reaches that specific page, Odoo will display the push
notification.

Below that field is the option to add a custom
`Icon Image`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the push
notification. This is an icon that appears beside the push notification.

To upload a new image, click the `✏️ (pencil) icon`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} when hovering over the `Icon
Image`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} camera icon. Doing so reveals
a pop-up window, in which the desired icon image can be located on the
hard drive, and subsequently uploaded.

Once that\'s complete, Odoo automatically updates the visual preview of
how the icon appears on the push notification.

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

Next, if the post is scheduled to be posted later, there is the option
to ensure the post is sent in the visitor\'s timezone, by enabling the
`Local Time`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. If enabled, Odoo
will send it at the appropriate, pre-determined time, taking the
visitor\'s location into consideration.

{.align-center}
:::

Then, there is the `Match all records`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field. This field provides the ability to target a
specific group of recipients in the database, based on certain criteria,
and can be applied to match `all`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`any`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of the rules.

To utilize this field, click the `+ Add condition`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button, which reveals an equation-like rule field.

In this equation-like rule field, specifiy the specific criteria Odoo
should take into account when sending this post to a particular target
audience.

{.align-center}

To add an additional rule, click the
`➕ (plus sign) icon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the far-right
of the rule.

To add a branch (series of additional rules based on the previous rule,
to further specify a target audience), click the unique
`branch icon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, located to the right
of the `➕ (plus
sign) icon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Lastly, click the `🗑️ (trash can) icon`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to delete any rule.

The size of the specified target audience of recipients is represented
by the number of `Records`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} displayed
beneath the rules.
