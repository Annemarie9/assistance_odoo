Bills
=====

Typical practices in restaurants or bars are to request the bill before
proceeding to payment or splitting it based on the items ordered. Odoo
POS provides two features to perform these tasks seamlessly: **Bill
Printing** and **Bill Splitting**.

Configuration
-------------

To activate the features, go to
`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select the POS, and activate
`Early Receipt Printing`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Allow Bill Splitting`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Restaurant & Bar`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

Bill printing
-------------

From an open session, click `Bill --> Print`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} at any moment to generate and print a bill.

Note

The printed bill is **not** final and will be updated to reflect any
changes to the order.

Bill splitting
--------------

From an open session, click `Split`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
to select the items to regroup. Once everything is selected, click
`Payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and proceed to checkout for
these items. Repeat for each guest.

\- Once you return to the table, the selected items are no longer on
order, as they have been paid for. - The feature is available as soon as
at least two items are ordered.
