Amazon order management
=======================

Order synchronization
---------------------

Orders are automatically fetched from Amazon, and synchronized in Odoo,
at regular intervals.

The synchronization is based on the Amazon status: only orders whose
status has changed since the last synchronization are fetched from
Amazon. This includes changes on either end (Amazon or Odoo).

For *FBA* (Fulfilled by Amazon), only *Shipped* and *Canceled* orders
are fetched.

For *FBM* (Fulfilled by Merchant), the same is done for *Unshipped* and
*Canceled* orders. For each synchronized order, a sales order and
customer are created in Odoo (if the customer is not already registered
in the database).

Note
:::

When an order is canceled in Amazon, and was already synchronized in
Odoo, the corresponding sales order is automatically canceled in Odoo.
:::

Force synchronization
---------------------

In order to force the synchronization of an order, whose status has
**not** changed since the previous synchronization, start by activating
the `developer mode <developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
This includes changes on either end (Amazon or Odoo).

Then, navigate to the Amazon account in Odoo
(`Sales app --> Configuration -->
Settings --> Connectors --> Amazon Sync --> Amazon Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}), and modify the date under
`Orders Follow-up --> Last Order Sync`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Be sure to pick a date that occurs prior to the last status change of
the desired order to synchronize and save. This will ensure
synchronization occurs correctly.

To immediately synchronize the orders of an Amazon account, switch to
`developer mode
<developer-mode>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, head to the Amazon
account in Odoo, and click `Sync Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. The same can be done with pickings by clicking
`Sync Pickings`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
:::

Manage deliveries in FBM
------------------------

Whenever an FBM (Fulfilled by Merchant) order is synchronized in Odoo, a
picking is instantly created in the *Inventory* app, along with a sales
order and customer record. Then, decide to either ship all the ordered
products to the customer at once, or ship products partially using
backorders.

When a picking related to the order is confirmed, a notification is then
sent to Amazon, who, in turn, notifies the customer that the order (or a
part of it) is on its way.

::: {.important}
::: {.title}

Amazon requires users to provide a tracking reference with each
delivery. This is needed to assign a carrier.

If the carrier doesn\'t automatically provide a tracking reference, one
must be set manually. This rule applies to all Amazon marketplaces.
:::

::: {.tip}
::: {.title}
Tip
:::

If the chosen carrier isn\'t supported by Odoo, a carrier with the same
name can still be created (e.g. create a carrier named
[easyship]{.title-ref}). The name used is **not** case sensitive, but be
mindful to avoid typos. If there are typos, Amazon will **not**
recognize them. Next, create a delivery carrier named [Self
Delivery]{.title-ref} to inform Amazon that the user will make the
deliveries. Even with this route, a tracking reference still **must** be
entered. Remember, the customer is notified by email about the delivery,
and the carrier, along with the tracking reference, are displayed in the
email to the customer.

### Manage errors when synchronizing deliveries {#manage/manage_delivery_errors}

Sometimes, Amazon can fail to correctly process all the information sent
by Odoo. In this case, Odoo sends an email listing all the shipments
that failed and the errors Amazon sent with them. In addition, these
shipments are flagged with a
`Synchronization with Amazon failed`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
tag.

Usually, the error can be corrected directly in the Amazon backend or in
Odoo. If the problem is corrected in Odoo, synchronize the shipment
again using the `Retry Amazon Sync`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button.

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

It might happen that Odoo receives a notification from Amazon saying
that some delivery information was not processed, but without specifying
which shipments were affected. In that case, all the shipments in an
unknown state will be treated as if they failed to synchronize. Once
Odoo receives a notification from Amazon saying that a shipment was
processed, its tag will change to
`Synchronized with Amazon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. To speed
up this process, on your Amazon account, click on
`Sync Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to manually synchronize
these orders, or click on `Recover Order`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and enter the relevant Amazon Order Reference.
:::

Follow deliveries in FBA
------------------------

When an FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) order is synchronized in Odoo, a stock
move is recorded in the *Inventory* app for each sales order item. That
way, it\'s saved in the system.

Inventory managers can access these stock moves by navigating to
`Inventory app -->
Reporting --> Moves History`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

For FBA orders, the stock move is automatically created in Odoo by the
Amazon connector, thanks to the shipping status of Amazon. When sending
new products to Amazon, the user should manually create a picking
(delivery order) to transfer these products from their warehouse to the
Amazon location.

::: {.tip}
::: {.title}
Tip
:::

To follow *Amazon (FBA)* stock in Odoo, make an inventory adjustment
after replenishing stock. An automated replenishment from reordering
rules can also be triggered on the Amazon location.
:::

The Amazon location is configurable by accessing the Amazon account
managed in Odoo. To access Amazon accounts in Odoo navigate to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings -->
Connectors --> Amazon Sync --> Amazon Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

All accounts of the same company use the same Amazon location, by
default. However, it is possible to follow the stock filtered by
marketplace.

To do that, first remove the marketplace, where the desired stock to
follow separately can be found, from the list of synchronized
marketplaces, which can be found by navigating to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings --> Connectors --> Amazon Sync --> Amazon
Accounts`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Next, create another registration for this account, and remove all
marketplaces\-\-- **except** the marketplace this is desired to be
isolated from the others.

Lastly, assign another stock location to the second registration of the
account.

Invoice and register payments
-----------------------------

### Issue invoices

Due to Amazon\'s policy of not sharing customer email addresses, it is
**not** possible to send invoices directly to Amazon customers from
Odoo. However, it **is** possible to manually upload the generated
invoices from Odoo to the Amazon back-end.

Additionally, for B2B clients, it is currently required to manually
retrieve VAT numbers from the Amazon back-end **before** creating an
invoice in Odoo.

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

For
`TaxCloud <../../../finance/accounting/taxes/taxcloud>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} users: invoices created from Amazon sales orders are **not**
synchronized with TaxCloud, since Amazon already includes them in its
own tax report to TaxCloud.
:::

::: {.warning}
::: {.title}
Warning
:::

TaxCloud integration will be decommissioned in Odoo 17+.
:::

### Register payments

Since customers pay Amazon as an intermediary, creating a dedicated
*Bank* journal (e.g. named [Amazon Payments]{.title-ref}), with a
dedicated *Bank and Cash* intermediary account is recommended.

Additionally, as Amazon makes a single monthly payment, selecting all
the invoices linked to a single payment is necessary when registering
payments.

To do that, use the appropriate `Journal`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dedicated to Amazon payments, and select
`Batch Deposit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as the
`Payment Method`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

Then, select all the generated payments, and click
`Actions --> Create batch payment
--> Validate`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

::: {.tip}
::: {.title}
Tip
:::

This same action can be performed with vendor bills from Amazon
dedicated to commissions.

When the balance is received in the bank account at the end of the
month, and the bank statements are recorded, credit the Amazon
intermediary account by the amount received.
:::

Follow Amazon sales in sales reporting
--------------------------------------

On the Amazon account profile in Odoo, a sales team is set under the
`Order Follow-up`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

This gives quick access to important metrics related to sales reporting.
By default, the Amazon account\'s sales team is shared between all of
the company\'s accounts.

If desired, the sales team on the account can be changed for another, in
order to perform a separate reporting for the sales of this account.

::: {.tip}
::: {.title}
Tip
:::

It is also possible to perform reporting on a per-marketplace basis.

First, remove the desired marketplace from the list of synchronized
marketplaces.

To access the list of synchronized marketplaces in Odoo, navigate to
`Sales app
--> Configuration --> Settings --> Connectors --> Amazon Sync --> Amazon Accounts`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Then, create another registration for this account, and remove all other
marketplaces **except** the one to isolate.

Lastly, assign another sales team to one of the two registrations of the
account.
