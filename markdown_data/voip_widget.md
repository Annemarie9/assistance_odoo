VoIP widget
===========

The *VoIP* widget is an add-on made available to Odoo users through the
*VoIP* module. It is used to incorporate virtual telephony into the
database. The widget is the control center for making and managing calls
in Odoo.

Phone calls
-----------

To make phone calls while in the Odoo database, click the
`☎️ (phone)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, located in the top
navigation bar.

When clicked, a `VOIP`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} pop-up widget
appears in the lower-left corner of the Odoo database. The widget allows
users to freely navigate throughout the database, while making and
receiving calls.

When receiving calls in Odoo, the `VOIP`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} widget rings,and displays a notification. To close the
widget, click the `X (close)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in
the upper-right of the widget\'s screen.

If an *Incorrect Number* error message appears in the Odoo *VoIP*
widget, make sure to use the international format, leading with the
`+ (plus)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} sign, followed by the
international country code.

(E.g., +16506913277, where [+1]{.title-ref} is the international prefix
for the United States.)

Tabs
----

In all, there are three tabs (`Recent`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, `Next Activities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and `Contacts`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) present in the *VoIP*
widget, which are used for managing calls and day-to-day activities in
Odoo.

### Recent

Under the `Recent`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the *VoIP*
widget, the call history for the user is available. This includes
incoming and outgoing calls. Any number can be clicked to begin a call.

### Next activities

Under the `Next Activities`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of
the *VoIP* widget, a user can see any activities assigned to them, and
which ones are due to be completed for the day.

Click an activity from this tab to perform any actions including:
Sending an email, accessing their contact, scheduling another activity,
or accessing a linked record (such as a Sales Order, Lead/Opportunity,
or Project Task).

The user can also mark the activity as complete, edit the details of the
activity, or cancel it.

To call the customer related to a scheduled activity, click the
`📞 (phone)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, or click the
`⌨️ (keyboard)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon to dial another
number for the customer.
