Request time off
================

Once time off has been allocated to an employee, a request to use it can
be submitted.

Time off can be requested in one of two ways: either from the main *Time
Off* application `Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
(`Time Off app --> My Time --> Dashboard`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}), or from the `My Time Off`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard view
(`Time Off app --> My Time --> My Time Off`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}).

To create a new request for time off, click the `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button on either the main *Time Off*
`Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or the
`My Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard, in the
default list view.

Note
:::

Both `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} buttons allow the user to
request time off, but when requested from the
`Dashboard`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, a
`New Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} request form appears
in a pop-up window. When requested from the
`My Time Off`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} list view, the screen
navigates to a new time off request page, instead.
:::

Enter the following information on the `New Time Off`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} request form:

-   `Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: select the type
    of time off being requested from the drop-down menu.

-   `Dates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter the dates that the
    time off falls under. There are two fields to populate: the start
    and end dates. Click on either date field and a popover calendar
    appears.

    Click on the start date, then click on the end date. The selected
    start and end dates are circled, and the dates between them are
    highlighted (if applicable).

    If only requesting time off for a single day, click on the start
    date, then click the same date again for the end date.

    When the correct dates are selected, click the
    `Apply`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

    The selected dates now populate the two portions of the
    `Dates`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

    If the selected `Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    is configured to have the time off taken in hours, the following two
    fields also appear:

    -   `Half Day`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the time off
        request is for a half day, tick this checkbox. When this is
        selected, the second date field disappears, and is replaced with
        a drop-down menu. From that drop-down menu, select either
        `Morning`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
        `Afternoon`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to indicate which
        half of the day is being requested.
    -   `Custom Hours`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: if the time
        off requested is not a whole or half day, tick this checkbox. If
        selected, a `From`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
        `To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field appears beneath
        this option. Using the drop-down menu, select the start and end
        time for the time off request.

-   `Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field updates
    automatically once the `Date`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
    section is completed. If the `Date`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} section is modified, this section automatically
    updates to reflect the total time off requested. This field is in
    either hours or days, depending on how the selected
    `Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is configured.

-   `Description`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: enter a
    description for the time off request. This should include any
    details that managers and approvers may need to approve the request.

-   `Supporting Document`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: this field
    only appears if the `Time Off Type`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} selected allows for the attachment of documents.
    Click the `Attach File`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button,
    and a file explorer window appears.

    Navigate to the desired files that should be attached, select them,
    then click The `Open`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. The
    files then appear on the time off request form. Multiple documents
    can be attached, if necessary.

If the request was created from the `Dashboard`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, click the `Save & Close`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button to save the information, and submit the request.

If the form was completed from the `My Time Off`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} list view, the information is automatically saved as it
is entered. However, the form can be saved manually at any time by
clicking the `fa-cloud-upload`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(cloud upload)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon.
