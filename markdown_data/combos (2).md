Product combos
==============

The **Product Combos** feature allows users to define and manage
combination options for a single product.

In the context of a restaurant, the feature enables users to create
multiple-choice menus. For example, a user can define a main dish and
specify various options for sides, drinks, or desserts that customers
can combine with the main dish.

In retail, this feature allows you to create a product set with multiple
products to choose from and combine.

Configuration
-------------

First, you need to create combination choices. To do so:

1.  Go to
    `Point of Sale --> Products --> Product Combos`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.
2.  Name your combo and add the products you want customers to choose
    from by clicking `Add
    a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. You can also include an
    extra price for each option in the `Extra Price`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} column.

As a reference, the selected product\'s original price is displayed in
the `Original
Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

Second, you need to create a specific product to gather combo choices.
To do this:

1.  Go to `Point of Sale --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"} and click `New`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"}.

2.  Set the `Product Type`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to
    `Combo`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and fill in the `General
    Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

    ::: {.note}
    ::: {.title}
    Note
    :::

    The sales price of the combo product is fixed and does not vary
    based on the individual prices of included items or the quantity of
    items in the combo. The combo product price is only affected by the
    extra price optionally defined at the combo choice creation or if a
    variant of one of the items has a specified extra price.
    :::

3.  Go to the `Combo Choices`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
    click `Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select
    the combinations to add. You can also create a new combination at
    this step by clicking `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on
    the popup window.



Once you have created and added the combo choices into a product, you
can sell combos in your retail store or restaurant.

Practical application
---------------------

`Open a POS session <pos/session-start>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
and select the combo product. Choose the options and click
`Add to order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. As a reminder, the
extra price appears under the related choices.
