Replenish on order (MTO)
========================

*Replenish on order*, also known as *MTO* (make to order), is a
replenishment strategy that creates a draft order every time a product
is needed to fulfill a sales order (SO) or as a component in a
manufacturing order (MO).

-   For
    `purchased products <../../../purchase/manage_deals/rfq>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}, Odoo creates a
    `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
-   For `manufactured products
    <../../../manufacturing/basic_setup/configure_manufacturing_product>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}, it creates a
    `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}

If stock is available, no
`RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is generated
and the sale proceeds normally. Otherwise, the
`RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is generated
and directly linked to the originating
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} through a smart
button.

This approach offers clear traceability, since each
`RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is tied back
to its demand.

The `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} generated by
`MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is designed to
fulfill the originating `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}. These documents should normally be confirmed or adjusted
rather than cancelled. If the demand changes, update the document
instead of cancelling it.

Note
:::

If an `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is cancelled,
Odoo does not automatically generate a replacement. A new replenishment
document must be created manually, but it **cannot** be linked back to
the original `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} through
the smart button.

Finally, click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save the
change.

Unarchive MTO route {#inventory/warehouses_storage/unarchive-mto}
-------------------

In order to use the `MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
route, the `Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
feature must be enabled. To do so, navigate to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and tick the checkbox next to
`Multi-Step Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, under the
`Warehouse`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} heading.

By default, Odoo sets the `MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} route as *archived*. This is because
`MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is a somewhat niche
workflow that is only used by certain companies. However, it is easy to
unarchive the route in just a few simple steps.

To do so, begin by navigating to
`Inventory app --> Configuration --> Routes`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. On the `Routes`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page, click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon on
the right side of the search bar, and click the
`Archived`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter to enable it.

{.align-center}

After enabling the `Archived`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter,
the `Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page shows all routes
which are currently archived. Tick the checkbox next to
`Replenish on Order (MTO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, then
click the `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to reveal a
drop-down menu. From the drop-down menu, select
`Unarchive`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

{.align-center}

Finally, remove the `Archived`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter
from the search bar. The `Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
page now shows all unarchived routes, including
`Replenish on Order (MTO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which is
selectable on the *Inventory* tab of each product page.

Configure product for MTO
-------------------------

With the `MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} route
unarchived, products can now be properly configured to use replenish on
order. To do so, begin by going to
`Inventory app --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, then select an existing product, or click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to configure a new one.

On the product page, select the `Inventory`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab and enable the `Replenish on
Order (MTO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} route in the
`Routes`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, along with the
`Buy`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Manufacture`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} route.

::: {.important}
::: {.title}
Important
:::

The `Replenish on Order (MTO)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} route
**does not** work unless another route is selected as well. This is
because Odoo needs to know how to replenish the product when an order is
placed for it (buy or manufacture it).
:::

{.align-center}

If the product is purchased from a vendor to fulfill
`SOs (sales orders)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, enable the
`Can be Purchased`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} checkbox under the
product name. Doing so makes the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab appear alongside the other tabs below.

Click the `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab and specify
a `Vendor`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and the
`Price`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} they sell the product for.

::: {.important}
::: {.title}
Important
:::

Specifying a vendor is essential for this workflow, because Odoo cannot
generate an `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}
without knowing who the product is purchased from.
:::

If the product is manufactured, make sure it has a bill of materials
(BOM) configured for it. To do so, click the
`Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button at
the top of the screen, then click `New`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} on the `Bill of Materials`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} page to configure a new
`BOM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} for the
product.

::: {.seealso}
For a full overview of `BOM (bill of materials)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} creation, see the documentation on `bills of materials
<../../../manufacturing/basic_setup/bill_configuration>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}.
:::

Replenish using MTO
-------------------

After configuring a product to use the
`MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} route, a
replenishment order is created for it every time an
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} including the
product is confirmed. The type of order created depends on the second
route selected in addition to `MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

For example, if *Buy* was the second route selected, then a
`PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is created upon
confirmation of an `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

::: {.important}
::: {.title}
Important
:::

When the `MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} route is
enabled for a product, a replenishment order is always created upon
confirmation of an `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} or
`MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. This is the
case, even if there is enough stock of the product on-hand to fulfill
the `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}, without buying or
manufacturing additional units of it.
:::

While the `MTO (make to order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} route can
be used in unison with the *Buy* or *Manufacture* routes, the *Buy*
route is used as the example for this workflow. Begin by navigating to
the `Sales`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} app, then click
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, which opens a blank quotation
form.

On the blank quotation form, add a `Customer`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. Then, click `Add a product`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} under the `Order Lines`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and enter a product configured to use the *MTO*
and *Buy* routes. Click `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
and the quotation is turned into an `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}.

A `Purchase`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart button now appears
at the top of the page. Clicking it opens the
`RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} associated
with the `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

After receiving approval from the vendor that they can meet the demand
by the `Expected
Arrival`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} date, click
`Confirm Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to turn it into a
`PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. A purple `Receive
Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button now appears above
the `PO (purchase order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. Once the
products are received, click `Receive Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to open the receipt order, and click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to enter the products into
inventory.

Return to the `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} by
clicking the `SO`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} breadcrumb, or by
navigating to `Sales app --> Orders --> Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and selecting
the`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

Finally, click the `Delivery`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} smart
button at the top of the order to open the delivery order. Once the
products have been shipped to the customer, click
`Validate`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to confirm the delivery.

### Cancelling an SO with an MTO product

When a `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} is cancelled,
and it had created an `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} or `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, the related delivery order is cancelled automatically.
However, the `RFQ (request for quotation)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} or `MO (manufacturing order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} themselves are **not** cancelled. Instead, a warning
appears in their chatter noting the `SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} cancellation. These documents remain active, so the user
can either cancel them manually or repurpose the replenishment for
another order.
