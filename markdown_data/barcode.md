Barcodes
========

Using a barcode scanner to process point-of-sale orders improves your
efficiency in providing quicker customer service. Barcode scanners can
be used both to scan products or to log employees into a POS session.

Configuration
-------------

To use a barcode scanner, you must enable the feature in the Inventory
app. Go to `Inventory --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, in the `Barcode`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section, tick `Barcode Scanner`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} and save.

`Activate barcode scanners </applications/inventory_and_mrp/barcode/setup/software>`{.interpreted-text

Once enabled in **Inventory**, you can use the barcode feature in
**Point of Sale** with products that have a barcode number assigned.

Assign barcodes
---------------

### To your products

To use this feature in POS, your products must have barcodes assigned.
To do so, go to
`Point of Sale --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and open a **product form**. Add a barcode number
in the `Barcode`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field in the
`General Information`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

### To your employees

To add an identification number to an employee, go to the **Employees**
app and open an **employee form**. Choose an identification number for
your employee and fill in the `PIN Code`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field in the `HR Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab.

Use barcodes
------------

### Scan products

Scan a product\'s barcode using a barcode scanner. Doing so adds it
directly to the cart. To change the quantity, scan a product as many
times as needed, or click `Qty`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
enter the number of products using the keypad.

You can also enter the barcode number manually in the search bar to look
for the product. Then, click it to add it to the cart.

### Log employees

You can also use a barcode scanner to log your employees. To do so,
`restrict access
<pos/employee_login/configuration>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to the
POS and `use barcodes to log your employees in
<pos/employee_login/badge>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} your POS.
