Pro-forma invoices
==================

A *pro-forma invoice* is an abridged or estimated invoice sent in
advance of a delivery of goods. It notes the kind and quantity of goods,
their value, and other important information, such as weight and
transportation charges.

Pro-forma invoices are commonly used as preliminary invoices with a
quotation. They are also used during importation for customs purposes.
They differ from a normal invoice, in that they are *not* a demand (or
request) for payment.

Configuration
-------------

In order to utilize pro-forma invoices, the *Pro-Forma Invoice* feature
**must** be activated.

To enable this feature, navigate to
`Sales app --> Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, and in the
`Quotations \& Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section, click
the checkbox next to `Pro-Forma
Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Then, click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to save all changes.

Send pro-forma invoice
----------------------

With the `Pro-Forma Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} feature
activated, the option to send a pro-forma invoice is now available on
any quotation or sales order, via the
`Send Pro-Forma Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

Note
:::

Pro-forma invoices can **not** be sent for a sales order or quotation if
an invoice for a down payment has already been sent, or for a recurring
subscription.

In either case, the `Send Pro-Froma Invoice`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button does **not** appear.

However, pro-forma invoices **can** be sent for services, event
registrations, courses, and/or new subscriptions. Pro-forma invoices are
not limited to physical, consumable, or storable goods.
:::

When the `Send Pro-Forma Invoice`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button is clicked, a pop-up window appears, from which an email can be
sent.

In the pop-up window, the `Recipients`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field is auto-populated with the customer from the
sales order or quotation. The `Subject`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field and the body of the email can be modified, if
necessary.

The pro-forma invoice is automatically added as an attachment to the
email.

When ready, click `Send`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and Odoo
instantly sends the email, with the attached pro-forma invoice, to the
customer.
