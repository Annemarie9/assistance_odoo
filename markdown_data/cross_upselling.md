Cross-selling and upselling
===========================

`Cross-selling <ecommerce/cross_selling>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
and
`upselling <ecommerce/cross_upselling/alternative>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} are sales techniques designed to encourage customers to
purchase additional or higher-priced products and services from your
`catalog`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

Cross-selling {#ecommerce/cross_selling}
-------------

Cross-selling can be achieved by suggesting
`optional products <ecommerce/cross_upselling/optional>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} when items are added to the cart or by recommending
`accessory products <ecommerce/cross_upselling/accessory>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} on the checkout page.

### Optional products {#ecommerce/cross_upselling/optional}

**Optional products** are suggested when the customer selects a product
and clicks `Add to cart`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To enable **optional products**, go to
`Website --> eCommerce --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select a product, go to the
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and enter the products
you wish to feature in the `Optional Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.



### Accessory products {#ecommerce/cross_upselling/accessory}

**Accessory products** are showcased in the
`Suggested Accessories`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section
during the `Review Order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} step, just
before proceeding to checkout.

To enable **accessory products**, go to
`Website --> eCommerce --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select a product, go to the
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, and enter the products
you wish to feature in the `Accessory Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} field.



Upselling {#ecommerce/cross_upselling/alternative}
---------

You can display **alternative products** at the bottom of the product
page as an upselling technique, encouraging customers to consider a more
expensive variant or product than their initial choice by presenting
appealing alternatives.



To enable alternative products, navigate to
`Website --> eCommerce --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}, select the desired product, and go to the
`Sales`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. In the
`Alternative Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, add the
products you want to feature.

Click `Go to Website`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to view the
alternative products displayed at the bottom of the product page.

To adjust the settings, click `Edit`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
and select the related
`building block <../../website/web_design/building_blocks>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. In the `Customize`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab,
scroll to the `Alternative Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
section and modify the settings as needed to tailor the display to your
preferences.
