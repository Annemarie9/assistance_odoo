Mail Plugins
============

::: {.toctree titlesonly=""}
mail\_plugins/outlook mail\_plugins/gmail
:::

Mail Plugins are connectors that bridge your mailbox with your Odoo
database. With them, you can interact with your Odoo database directly
from your mailbox by:

-   Creating leads and centralizing prospects\' emails into the CRM app.
-   Generating tasks in any Odoo project.
-   Creating tickets in the Helpdesk app.
-   Searching and storing insights on your contacts.

Mail Plugins are available for
`Outlook <mail_plugins/outlook>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
`Gmail
<mail_plugins/gmail>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}.

Pricing {#mail_plugins/pricing}
-------

Mail Plugins are **free** to install and use.

However, they can provide **Lead Enrichment**, which is part of a paid
service known as **Lead Generation**.

Mail plugins allow you to test Lead Enrichment for free, whether you
connect the plugins to a database or not. After a while, the plugins ask
you to buy `../../essentials/in_app_purchase`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} credits if you would like to keep using this service.

### Lead Generation IAP service {#mail_plugins/lead-generation}

Lead Enrichment uses the *Lead Generation IAP service*. Each request
consumes one *Lead Generation credit*.

To buy credits, go to
`Settings --> CRM --> Lead Enrichment --> Buy credits`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} and select a package.
