Shop Floor time tracking
========================

By signing in to the Odoo *Shop Floor* module as *operators*, employees
are able to track the amount of time they spend working on each work
order.

Odoo tracks the time it takes to complete each work order, as well as
the time each operator spends on each work order.

Operator sign in
----------------

To sign in to the *Shop Floor* module as an operator, sign in to the
Odoo database, and open the `Shop Floor`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} module. The employee profile that is signed in to
the database is automatically signed in as an operator.

All active operators are listed in the operator panel on the left side
of the module. The panel can be opened or collapsed by clicking the
`show/hide panel (white square with black column on
left side)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, located in the
top-left corner of the module.

To sign in to *Shop Floor* as a different employee, click the
`+ Add Operator`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the bottom
of the panel. Doing so opens the `Select Employee`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window, which lists every employee that is able
to sign in to the module.

Click on a specific employee to sign in using their profile. If no PIN
code is required to sign in as that employee, the profile will be signed
in automatically.

If a PIN code is required, a `Password?`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} pop-up window appears, showing a number pad, from which
the code can be entered. Enter the code using the number pad, and click
`Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to sign in to the *Shop
Floor* module.

A PIN code can be set for each employee, which must be entered each time
they sign in to the *Shop Floor* module, check in or out in the *Kiosk
Mode* of the *Attendances* application, or sign in as a cashier in the
*Point of Sale* application.

To set an employee PIN, navigate to the `Employees`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} app, and select a specific employee. At the bottom
of the employee\'s form, click on the `HR Settings`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, and enter a numerical code in the
`PIN Code`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.
:::

Once an employee is signed in to the module, their name appears in the
operator panel, along with every other employee that has signed in.
While the panel can list multiple employees, only one employee can be
active at any given time, on a single instance of the *Shop Floor*
module.

Click on an employee\'s name to make their profile active. The active
employee appears highlighted in blue, while employees that are signed
in, but not active, have their names faded out.

To sign out a specific employee from the module, click the
`X (remove)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to their
name, in the operator panel.

Track work order duration
-------------------------

To track time spent working on a work order, begin by selecting the
employee working on it from the operator panel.

Next, navigate to the page for the work center where the work order is
scheduled to be carried out. This can be done by selecting the work
center from the top navigation in the *Shop Floor* module, or by
clicking the name of the work center on the card for the manufacturing
order (MO) that the work order is a part of.

On the page for the work center, find the card for the work order. Once
work begins, click the header of the work order card to start timing the
duration it takes to complete. This duration is displayed by a timer on
the header of the work order card, which tracks the collective time
spent working on the work order, by all employees.

In addition, the reference number of the work order appears in the
operator panel, under the name of the employee working on it, along with
a second timer, which tracks the amount of time the employee has spent
on the work order individually. This timer only reflects work done
during the current session, even if the employee has previously worked
on the work order.

Employees are able to work on multiple work orders simultaneously, and
track their time for each. The reference number for each work order
being worked on appears below the employee\'s name, along with a timer.

{.align-center}

To pause the timer on the work order card, and remove the work order
from below the employee\'s name on the operator panel, click the header
a second time.

Once the work order is completed, click the
`Mark as Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button at the bottom
of the work order card, which causes the card to fade away. If the timer
is still active, it stops once the card disappears completely.

View work order duration
------------------------

To view the duration of a work order, navigate to
`Manufacturing app --> Operations
--> Manufacturing Orders`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}, and
select an `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

To view and select `MOs (Manufacturing Orders)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"} that have been completed and marked as *Done*, remove the
`To Do`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter from the
`Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar, by clicking on the
`X (close)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the right side
of the filter.

On the page for the `MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text
role="abbr"}, click on the `Work Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab to see a list of all work orders included in the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}. The time it
took to complete each work order is displayed in the
`Real Duration`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column of the tab.

The *Real Duration* represents the total time spent working on the work
order by all workers who worked on it. It includes time tracked in the
*Shop Floor* module, as well as time tracked on the
`Work Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of the
`MO (Manufacturing Order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"} itself.
