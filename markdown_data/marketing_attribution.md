Marketing attribution reports
=============================

Use the Odoo *CRM* app to compile a *marketing attribution report*,
which analyzes the source of leads, and groups them in such a way as to
calculate marketing\'s overall impact on lead generation, attribution,
won rate, and more.

Leads Analysis dashboard
------------------------

Begin by navigating to the `Leads Analysis`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} dashboard by going to `CRM app
--> Reporting --> Leads`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}.

Reports can also be run on the `CRM app --> Leads`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} dashboard, which is **only** accessible if the
*Leads* feature has been activated on the *Settings* page.

If the *Leads* feature has **not** been activated, the
`CRM app --> Sales --> My
Pipeline`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"} dashboard can also be
used to run reports.

Both dashboards contain the necessary *Filters* and *Group By* criteria
to run an attribution report.

The `fa-area-chart`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(graph)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} view is shown, by default,
with `Active or
Inactive`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and
`Created on: [current year]`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filters
active in the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar. The
graph visualization displays the number of leads generated, by month and
by sales team, with each sales team attributed to its own color per
month shown.

Switch the view to the `oi-view-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(list)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option, by clicking the
respective icon located at the top-right of the dashboard. This allows
leads to easily be displayed in the grouping set by the *Group By*
parameters.

Add UTM parameters
------------------

*Urchin Tracking Modules (UTMs)* are snippets of text embedded in URLs
that are used to track visitor data. This includes parameters relating
to how a visitor reached the link, such as the type of website visited,
and/or marketing campaign the visit came from.

Odoo can use these UTMs as parameters in the marketing attribution
report to track the metrics and performance of marketing campaigns.

### Create UTMs

The
`link tracker <../../../websites/website/reporting/link_tracker>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} in Odoo can be used to create and configure UTMs.

UTMs can also be automatically generated by the `Email Marketing
<../../../marketing/email_marketing>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"} and
`Marketing Automation
<../../../marketing/marketing_automation>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
apps.

The UTM parameters used in a marketing attribution report are *Medium*,
*Source*, and *Campaign*, in descending order of coverage.

-   *Medium* is the UTM with the widest coverage, and is used to
    identify the medium used to access the link. This can include
    mediums such as social media, email, or cost per click (CPC).
-   *Source* is more narrow, and is used to identify the source of
    traffic. For example, the name of a website, search engine used, or
    a specific social media platform.
-   *Campaign* is the most narrow, and can track specific marketing
    campaigns by name. This can include a contest or product name, type
    of sale, etc.

Create reports
--------------

To start creating a report, click the `fa-caret-down`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(down arrow)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to the
right of the `Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar to see
the list of filtering and grouping parameters.

`Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, located in the left column
of the search options, can be used to keep only the results that fit the
filter. For example, selecting the `Won`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} filter only shows leads that have been won in the
attribution report.

`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, found in the middle
column, is used to organize the results into groups, and can be used
with or without filters.

::: {.tip}
::: {.title}
Tip
:::

Setting multiple `Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} options
creates nested groups, according to which option is selected first. For
example, selecting `Medium`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, followed
by `Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and then
`Campaign`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, in
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, sorts all results
*first* by medium, *then* by the specific sources in each medium,
followed by the campaigns in each source.

This can be verified by looking at the direction, and order, of the
selections in the group tile that appears in the
`Search...`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} bar.

{.align-center}
:::

::: {.example}
For a useful first report:

#\. From the `Filters`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, select
the `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} filter to view only
leads that are still marked as active. \#. From the
`Group By`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column, select (in this
specific order) `Source`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, followed by
the `City`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
`Country`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, depending on which
grouping is more relevant.

{.align-center}

This report contains all active leads, grouped first by the source of
the lead, then by the city or country each lead is from. This is useful
to see the density of active opportunities sorted by location.

With this data, marketing campaigns, such as conferences or billboards,
can be targeted to the locations generating the largest amount of
potential revenue. Similarly, more attention can be put toward
increasing outreach in locations where existing marketing campaigns are
less effective.

Export reports
--------------

To set the measures of the report, begin by navigating to the
`oi-view-pivot`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(pivot view)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the
`Leads Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} dashboard.

Click the `Measures`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button to view
the available measures of the report. Select the desired measures from
the drop-down menu (multiple measures can be selected), and verify the
measures, filters, and groups are all displayed correctly in the pivot
table. This ensures the data is ready for export.

To quickly export the data in a list, as a .xlsx file, navigate to the
`oi-view-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(list view)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click on the
`Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `(gear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, located
to the right of `Lead Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
the top-left of the page, and click `fa-upload`{.interpreted-text
role="icon"} `Export All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The report
downloads automatically as a .xlsx file.

For more export options, the report can be exported to the Odoo
*Documents* app. From the `oi-view-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(list view)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of
`Leads Analysis`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} page, begin by
clicking the `Actions`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `(gear)`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} icon again. Now, navigate to
`fa-table`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and click
`oi-view-list`{.interpreted-text role="icon"} `Insert list in
spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. A pop-up window titled,
`Select a spreadsheet to insert your list.`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} appears.

The report can be renamed using the [Name of the list]{.title-ref}
field, if desired. The number of items on the report can be set with the
field labeled: [Insert the first \_ records of the list]{.title-ref}.
Next, select either a new `Blank spreadsheet`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, or export into an existing spreadsheet. Finally, click
the `Confirm`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button.

{.align-center}

To export the report as a .xlsx file, for use in an external
spreadsheets program, click the `Actions`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} `fa-cog`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(gear)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, and select the
`fa-upload`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`Export All`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} option. If prompted,
choose a file location, name the file, then click
`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
