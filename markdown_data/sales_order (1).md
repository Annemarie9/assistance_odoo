Sales orders
============

When working in retail, you might need to order products directly from
your Point of sale. Fortunately, Odoo Point of Sale is fully integrated
with Odoo Sales, meaning that you can create a sales order and pay for
it directly from your point of sale.

Select a sales order
--------------------

From the **Point of Sale** application, open a new session. Then, click
on `Quotations/Orders`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to get the
complete list of quotations and sales orders created on the sales
application.

To ease finding the right sales order, you can filter that list on the
**customer** or on the **order reference**. You can also set the
customer before clicking on `Quotations/Orders`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to reduce the list to one particular customer.

Apply a down payment or settle the order
----------------------------------------

From the list of sales order, select one to make a payment.

You can either:

-   Settle the order **partially**: after clicking on
    `Apply a down payment`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, enter the
    percentage of down payment you want the customer to pay. Then, click
    on `ok`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} and proceed with the
    order.
-   Settle the order **completely**: click on
    `Settle the order`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to pay for the
    total of the sales order.

Once you settle a sales order, the applied down payment is automatically
deducted from the total amount.
