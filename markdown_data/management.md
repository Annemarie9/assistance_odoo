Articles management
===================

Managing articles effectively is key to maximizing the value of your
knowledge resources, whether working on a research project, studying for
an exam, or building a knowledge database for your business. Knowledge
allows you to fully manage your articles, from
`creation <management/create>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to
`removal <management/remove>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, through
`sharing
<management/share>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`structure <management/structure>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

You can find most tools to manage articles by clicking the vertical
ellipsis button (`⋮`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) at the right
side of the top bar. From there, you can move, lock, delete, or
duplicate an article.



Creation, sharing, and removal of articles
------------------------------------------

### Creation {#management/create}

To create articles, click the `+ New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
button on the right side of the top bar or the `+`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} button next to a category or another article.

### Sharing {#management/share}

You can share articles with internal or external users. To do so, open
the share menu by clicking `Share`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in
the top-right menu of articles.

#### Invite users

To share articles with specific users (internal or external, such as a
partner or a customer), click `Invite`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}. This opens a pop-up window in which you can choose the
`Permission`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
`(i.e, access rights) <management/categories>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and enter the `Recipients`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}\' name or email.

You can also restrict a specific user from accessing the article by
selecting `No access`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} permission.



#### Share online

To share articles **online**, activate the
`Share to web`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. Doing so
generates a URL link anyone can use to view the article.

Additionally, the share menu displays the default permission for
internal members along with all the users who have been granted specific
permission.



### Removal {#management/remove}

To remove an article, you can either **delete** it or **archive** it.

To delete an article, open it and click the vertical ellipsis button
`(⋮) -->
Delete`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. The article is moved to
the trash for 30 days before being permanently deleted. To restore it,
click `Open the Trash`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, select the
article, and click `Restore`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

To archive articles, click `Search`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"},
select the article(s), and click
`Action --> Archive --> Archive`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Archived articles are hidden from the search
menu. To retrieve an archived article, add a custom filter to display
them (`Search -->
Filters --> Add Custom Filter`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and set `Active`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} as
`is No`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}). Then, select the article(s)
and go to `Action --> Unarchive`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}.

Structure of articles {#management/structure}
---------------------

Articles are organized into a hierarchical structure wherein the article
on top is a parent article, and those underneath are called nested
articles. This structure allows the grouping of related articles.

To establish this hierarchy, create new articles by clicking the
`+`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button next to the parent-to-be
article, or move existing articles by either dragging and dropping them
under the parent-to-be or by clicking the vertical ellipsis button
(`⋮`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}), clicking `Move
To`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on the toolbox and selecting the
article to use as a parent.

### Categories {#management/categories}

Additionally, articles are divided into four categories that can be
found on the left sidebar. These categories give articles default
**access rights**.

-   `Favorites`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: You can set any
    article you can access as a favorite. To do so, click the
    star-shaped icon (`★`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}) in the
    top-right menu of articles. Marking articles as **favorites** is
    user-specific and does not affect other users.
-   `Workspace`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Articles displayed
    in that category are available to all internal users. These users
    have the right to read, modify or share these articles.
-   `Shared`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Articles displayed in
    that category are those you shared with internal users, external
    users, or shared with you.
-   `Private`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}: Articles displayed in
    that category are only available to you.
