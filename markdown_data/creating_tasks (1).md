Creating field service tasks
============================

Tasks in Odoo Field Service can be created manually or automatically,
including from sales orders or helpdesk tickets.

Manual task creation
--------------------

To create a new field service task:

1.  Open the Field service app and go to
    `Field Service --> All Tasks --> All Tasks`{.interpreted-text
    role="menuselection"}.
2.  Click `New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.
3.  Fill in the task title, `Customer`{.interpreted-text
    role="guilabel"} and any other
    `optional field <task_creation/task-configuration>`{.interpreted-text
    role="ref"}, then save manually.

Task creation from a sales order
--------------------------------

This feature allows for field service tasks to be automatically created
from a sales order. When you create a quotation with the
`service product <sales/invoicing/configured-service-product>`{.interpreted-text
role="ref"} and confirm it, a task is automatically created in your
Field Service project. Click the `Tasks`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} smart button to access it from the sales order.

Task creation from a helpdesk ticket
------------------------------------

If you have the Helpdesk app installed, you can
`create field service tasks from a helpdesk
ticket <helpdesk/field>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.
