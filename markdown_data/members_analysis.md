Navigate the report
-------------------

The default *Members Analysis* report displays a bar chart, measuring
the `Quantity`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} of memberships against
the amount of `Revenue Done`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The
data is grouped by the assigned salesperson, then by the month the
membership begins.
