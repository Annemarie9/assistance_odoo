Optional products
=================

The use of optional products is a marketing strategy that involves the
cross-selling of products along with a core product. The aim is to offer
useful and related products to customers, which may result in an
increased sale.

For instance, if a customer wants to buy a car, they have the choice to
order massaging seats, as well, or ignore the offer and simply buy the
car. Presenting the choice to purchase optional products enhances the
customer experience.

Optional products on quotations
-------------------------------

With the Odoo *Sales* application, it is possible to add or modify
optional products directly on quotations by navigating to the
`Optional Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab on a
quotation form.

To add an optional product(s) to a quotation, click
`Add a product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} in the
`Optional Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab of a
quotation. Doing so reveals a blank field in the
`Product`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} column.

When clicked, a drop-down menu with products from the database appear.
Select the desired product from the drop-down menu to add it as an
optional product to the quotation template.

If the desired product isn\'t readily visible, type the name of the
desired product in the field, and the option appears in the drop-down
menu. Then, select that desired product to add it to the quotation.

Note
:::

When a product is added, the default `Quantity`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} is [1]{.title-ref}, but that can be edited at any time.
:::

To delete any line item from the `Optional Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab, click the `🗑️ (trash
can)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon.

Click the `Preview`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button, located
in the upper-left corner of the quotation, to reveal a preview of the
quotation customers would receive, via email, along with the optional
products they can potentially add to their order, located in the
`Options`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} section.

Customers are able to add different optional products to an order by
clicking the `🛒
(shopping cart)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon, located to the
right of the optional product line.

If a customer selects optional products, these are automatically added
to the quotation managed by the salesperson.

When the customer adds an optional product(s) to an order, the
salesperson is instantly notified about the change, along with any other
change the customer makes to an order. This allows salespeople to stay
up-to-date with everything related to an order in the backend of the
*Sales* application.

Optional products on quotation templates
----------------------------------------

Be sure to review the `quote_template`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}
documentation to better understand how quotation templates work before
reading the following information.
:::

For quotation templates, just like a typical quotation form, there is
also an `Optional
Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, wherein related
products or services can be added to a quotation template.

To add optional products to a quotation template, navigate to
`Sales app -->
Configuration --> Quotation Templates`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, either select an existing quotation
template to edit, or create a new one by clicking
`New`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}.

On the quotation template form, click the
`Optional Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab. Under the
`Optional Products`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click
`Add a line`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, and select the desired
product to add as an optional product to the quotation template.

{.align-center}

The products added in the `Optional Products`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} tab are present in the quotation, by default, whenever
that particular quotation template is used. These products can be
removed, and additional products can be added, before the quotation is
sent to a customer.

Tip
:::

It\'s best to offer optional products that would encourage a customer to
add additional items to their order, or entice them to purchase a more
expensive version of their initially selected product.

For example, if a customer purchases a wooden chair, some optional
products could be: a warranty on that chair and/or a wooden chair with
leather seats.
