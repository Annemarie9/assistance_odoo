Participate in live chat
========================

*Operators* are the users who respond to live chat requests from
customers and website visitors. The information below outlines the
necessary steps for operators participating in live chat conversations
on an Odoo database.

Set an online chat name
-----------------------

Before participating in a live chat, operators may choose to update
their *Online Chat Name*. This is the name displayed to site visitors in
the live chat conversation.

To update the *Online Chat Name*, click on the user avatar in the
top-right corner of any page in the database. Select
`My Profile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu
to open the profile page. On the right side of the
`Preferences`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, locate the
`Online Chat Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and enter a
preferred name.

If a user\'s `Online Chat Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} is
not set, the name displayed defaults to the user\'s name that is
designated on their profile page.

::: {.example}
A user has their full name as their `User Name`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}, but they do not want to include their last name in a
live chat conversation. They would then set their
`Online Chat Name`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to include only
their first name.

Set online chat languages
-------------------------

If an operator speaks multiple languages, they can add this information
to their user profile. This information can then be used to determine
which conversations the operator is assigned. A visitor\'s language is
determined via their browser\'s language settings.

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

Conversations are assigned to operators based on a number of criteria,
including availability and the number of ongoing conversations. While
the operator\'s main language and additional languages are taken into
consideration, they do **not** supersede all other criteria.
:::

To add *Online Chat Languages*, click on the user avatar in the
top-right corner of any page in the database. Select
`My Profile`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} from the drop-down menu
to open the profile page. On the right side of the
`Preferences`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab, click into the
`Online Chat Language`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field, and
select one or more languages from the drop-down menu.

Only `languages <../../general/users/language>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"} that are enabled on the database can be selected in the
`Online Chat Language`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} field.

Join or leave a channel
-----------------------

To join a live chat channel, go to the
`Live Chat app --> Channels`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
and click the `Join`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button on the
Kanban card for the appropriate channel.

Any channel where the user is currently active shows a
`Leave`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} button. Click this button to
disconnect from the channel.

Operators that do not show any activity in Odoo for more than thirty
minutes are considered disconnected, and subsequently removed from the
channel.

Manage live chat requests
-------------------------

When an operator is active in a channel, chat windows open in the
bottom-right corner of the screen, no matter where they are in the
database. This allows them to access other pages and apps, while still
participating in the conversation.

Conversations can also be accessed by clicking the
`fa-comments`{.interpreted-text role="icon"}
`(messages)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} icon in the menu bar.

Live chat conversations can also be viewed by navigating to the
`Discuss app`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"}. New conversations
appear in bold under the `LIVECHAT`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
heading, located along the left panel.

{.align-center}

Click on a conversation in the left panel to select it. This opens the
conversation. From this view, an operator can participate in the chat
the same as they would in the normal chat window.
