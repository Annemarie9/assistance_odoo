Restaurant features
===================

Managing a restaurant or a bar comes with specific needs. The Point of
Sale application provides various features that allow performing all the
required tasks in such businesses.

Once the POS is set to be used in a restaurant or a bar, you can:

-   `organize your floors and tables to reflect your interior <restaurant/floors_tables>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"};
-   `take orders <restaurant/orders>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"};
-   `communicate with the kitchen or the bar through the POS <restaurant/kitchen_printing>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"};
-   `print bills in advance and split them <restaurant/bill_printing>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"};
-   `collect tips <restaurant/tips>`{.interpreted-text role="doc"}; and
-   `set different taxes for takeaway food <pricing/fiscal_position>`{.interpreted-text
    role="doc"}.

Configuration {#restaurant/configuration}
-------------

To enable the restaurant and bar-specific features, go to
`Point of Sale -->
Configuration --> Settings`{.interpreted-text role="menuselection"},
select the POS, and activate `Is a Bar/Restaurant`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"}.

These features are displayed in the `Restaurant & Bar`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} section.

Take orders {#restaurant/orders}
-----------

Click a table to access the POS interface and start taking your
customer\'s order. The system automatically associates the orders and
the table, allowing you to add more items later and generate a bill
specifically for that table\'s orders.

Once you have taken an order, click `Change table`{.interpreted-text
role="guilabel"} to return to the floor plan view.

As soon as you click a table, the number of guests is automatically set
to one. If you mistakenly select a table, click
`Release table`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} to free it or
`transfer the
customer <floors_tables/transfer>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to
another table.
