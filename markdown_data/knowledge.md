Knowledge
=========

**Odoo Knowledge** is a multipurpose productivity app that allows
internal users to enrich their business knowledge base and provide
individually or collaboratively gathered information.

The pages on which they gather content are called *articles*. They are
mainly composed of a title and a body. The latter is an HTML field
containing text, images, links to other articles, records from other
models, templates, etc.
