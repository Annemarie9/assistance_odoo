Serial numbers and lots
=======================

Working with **serial numbers** and **lots** allows tracking your
products\' movements. When products are tracked, the system identifies
their location based on their last movement.

To enable traceability, go to
`Point of Sale --> Products --> Products`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"}. Then, select a product and check the
`Tracking By Unique Serial Number`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} or
the `Tracking By Lots`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} box in the
`Inventory`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} tab.

Serial numbers and lots importation
-----------------------------------

You can import serial numbers in Point of Sale. To do so, select a
**sales order** or a **quotation** containing tracked products. Then,
agree to load the **Lots or Serial Numbers** linked to the
`SO (sales order)`{.interpreted-text role="abbr"}.

The imported tracking numbers appear below the tracked products. You can
modify them by clicking on the list-view button next to the products.

Serial numbers and lots creation
--------------------------------

If a tracked product is available in your POS, adding the product to the
cart opens a pop-up window where you can type or scan the product\'s
serial or lot numbers. To add more than one of the same tracked
products, click on **enter** to validate and start a new line.

:::

\- Changing a tracked product\'s quantity using the numpad turns the
list-view button red. Click on it to add the missing lot and serial
numbers. - `Lot & Serial Number(s)`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}
are `required`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"} on tracked products
but not mandatory. Meaning that not attributing some or any does **not**
prevent from completing the sale.
