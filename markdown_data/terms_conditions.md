Default terms and conditions (T&C)
==================================

Specifying terms and conditions is essential to establish important
contractual points, such as return and refunds, warranty, and after-sale
services.

You can add default terms and conditions at the bottom of all customer
invoices, sales orders, and quotations, either as text or a link to a
web page.

You can also add a PDF version of your terms and conditions as an
attachment when sending the document via email. Edit the email templates
if you want to include them by default.

Alternatively, to display the terms and conditions on a web page, select
the `Add a link

`Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. Click
`Update Terms`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}, edit the content, and
click `Save`{.interpreted-text role="guilabel"}. The link to that page
is then added as a note in your document.

the Website app is activated, the `Edit in
